Carol:  Definitely, Bob. It's important for us to share any observations we have. I'll start by saying that I've noticed Dave has been relatively quiet so far. It could be because he's trying to play it safe as a mafia, or maybe he's just a bit shy. But it's worth keeping an eye on him.

Alice:  I understand the need for caution, but I still have some suspicions about Dave. I noticed that he hasn't really contributed much to the discussion so far, and that could be because he's trying to avoid drawing attention to himself. Plus, his response just now seemed a bit too defensive. It's worth keeping an eye on him.
